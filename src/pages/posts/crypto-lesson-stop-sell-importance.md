# The Importance of Setting a "Stop Sell"
## Crypto currency markets are known to be wavy. It is a wise decision when making any trade to make a "stop sell" trade immediately after entering the market.

### What is a Stop Sell trade?

A stop sell trade means to literally "stop" at this amount of value per coin, and sell a specific amount of crypto currency.

After purchasing X amount of coins with Y amount of money, you should set the stop sell at the same transaction if you wish to play it extremely safe. This does not account for fees.

Assuming the market is in an uptrend, this is a last resort to make sure you bail off "approximately" where you jumped in.

When I think approximately, you need to think about the opportunity to buy and sell a coin as a club.

If there are not many people, there is not much of a line to get in the club. You see a price you like, and you can walk up to the door and pay that fee to get into the club.

But if there are a ton of people trying to get in at the price you liked, the chances of you getting in before them act as a line. And with each person entering or exiting, the price fluctuates and you cannot be guaranteed to get what you want 100%.
