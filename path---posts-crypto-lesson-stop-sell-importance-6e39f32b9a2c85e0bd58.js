It is a wise decision when making any trade to make a “stop sell” trade immediately after entering the market.</h2>\n<h3>What is a Stop Sell trade?</h3>\n<p>A stop sell trade means to literally “stop” at this amount of value per coin, and sell a specific amount of crypto currency.</p>\n<p>After purchasing X amount of coins with Y amount of money, you should set the stop sell at the same transaction if you wish to play it extremely safe. This does not account for fees.</p>\n<p>Assuming the market is in an uptrend, this is a last resort to make sure you bail off “approximately” where you jumped in.</p>\n<p>When I think approximately, you need to think about the opportunity to buy and sell a coin as a club.</p>\n<p>If there are not many people, there is not much of a line to get in the club. You see a price you like, and you can walk up to the door and pay that fee to get into the club.</p>\n<p>But if there are a ton of people trying to get in at the price you liked, the chances of you getting in before them act as a line. And with each person entering or exiting, the price fluctuates and you cannot be guaranteed to get what you want 100%.</p>",frontmatter:{title:""}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/crypto-lesson-stop-sell-importance/"}}}});
