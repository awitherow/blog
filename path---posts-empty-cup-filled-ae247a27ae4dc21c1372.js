Though the art is new, I notice how the flavours of the past move my present.</p>\n<p>Years of experience in many things are constantly seeping into the now from where they lie in my body as memories.</p>\n<p>The flow of swimming, the grounding of yoga, the exertion of weight training, the explosiveness of Karate. Now, the simplicity of Wing Chun.</p>\n<p>We are practicing a simple downward hand block followed by a push. I get it, I am already progressing into higher forms of expression by making the motion into a wave of sorts, a single flow.</p>\n<p>Sensei calls us to form a circle, he has yet to choose who to help reinforce the teachings for the rest of the class.</p>\n<p>Ego erupts from within as I walk forward to prepare myself. Telling the class to watch, he instructs me “Push my hands down, and then press forward”.</p>\n<p>I do what I have been doing the last hour and show him my progressed form. His face creases with frustration, “You are not doing what I ask. Again”.</p>\n<p>My ego throatily growls, and I repeat what I had done before.</p>\n<p>“You are not listening” he says. Irritation rips from my lips, incredulous at the concept. I disagree.</p>\n<p>“Okay, continue.”</p>\n<p>I push forward with my technique again, when his hands blur. Instantly, I am disrupted. My defense is wide open. His open palm lies ready to strike under the jaw. If landed, the blow would be devastating.</p>\n<p>“If you try to do two things at once without mastering either first, you will leave yourself vulnerable. Empty your cup and fill it from mine” he says to me, his eyes wrinkling with contained laughter.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Sensei.</p>",frontmatter:{title:""}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/empty-cup-filled/"}}}});
